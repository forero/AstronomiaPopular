* [Decolonising Science Reading List - It’s The End of Science As You Know It](https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f#.j2abv77j4) An October 2016 Introduction
In April, 2015, one of the most visible topics of discussion in the Astronomy community was the planned Thirty Meter Telescope and protests against it from Native Hawaiians who 
didn’t want it built on Mauna Kea. I wrote a lot about this on social media, spending some significant time trying to contextualize the debate. This reading list was originally created in response to requests for where I was getting some of the information from. A lot of people asked me about what I’d been reading as reference points for my commentary on the relationship between colonialism and what we usually call “modern science.”
In August 2016 I updated to announce: I’m happy to report that Sarah Tuttle and I will be contributing to this list in future thanks to this FQXi grant that we are co-I/PI on: Epistemological Schemata of Astro|Physics: A Reconstruction of Observers.
